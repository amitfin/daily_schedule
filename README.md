The Daily Schedule integration provides a binary sensor that gets its ON/OFF state according to the user-defined schedule.
A schedule is a list of time ranges (FROM and TO).

A demo video clip can be found [here](https://youtu.be/3cVtPPC3S4U).

## Adding Daily Schedule

Use this link:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=daily_schedule)

Or, in the Home Assistant UI go through the following path:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show your settings menu.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config/)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show your devices.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/devices.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/devices/)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show your helper entities.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/helpers.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/helpers/)

=> Click "+ Create helper" button and search for "Daily Schedule".

Here are screenshots from the new Daily Schedule flow:

## Editing Daily Schedule

In the Home Assistant UI go through the following path:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show your settings menu.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config/)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show your devices.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/devices.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/devices/)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show your helper entities.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/helpers.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/helpers/)

=> Find and click the entry on the list

=> Click the "Daily Schedule Options"

Follow the UI flow to add or remove time ranges:
1) Uncheck a time range to remove it.
2) Check the "Add a new time range" for adding a new time range.
3) It's not possible to edit a time range. Instead, remove the exsiting one and add a new one, which can be done in a single step.

## Schedule Validation
The schedule can be saved only if it passes the following checks:
1. Any time range length must be positive (not zero or negative).
2. Time ranges canâ€™t overlap but can adjust.
3. The TO of the latest time range (in the day) can be smaller or equal to its FROM, and it will be treated as a time in the following day.
    - This means that the binary sensor will be always ON when there is a single time range with the same FROM and TO.
